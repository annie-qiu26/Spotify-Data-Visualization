# Project Proposal
## General Summary
I'm planning to use Spotify's API to find data on top artists played and top
artists played based on user. I'm also taking into account the popularity of
each of their songs and albums. Given this data, I want to use openFrameworks
to display the data in a visually appeasing way. Users can search for playlists
and the application will summarize the type of music and popularity of the
artists. Then I want to artistically express the data in openFrameworks with
an interactive feature for users. They can analyze their data and click on
an artist "bubble" to listen to one of their songs and get more statistics about
them.
